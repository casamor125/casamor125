Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Biel, a 21-year-old currently immersed in a professional development journey, pursuing a degree in Multiplatform Application Development. My programming experiences have primarily revolved around Java and HTML/CSS, but i've done to a little of  Python, Kotlin, and Oracle SQL, with hands-on projects in the realm of software development. Outside the digital landscape, I've delved into the world of animation, creating some creative animations at home.

Apart from my current studies, I invested two years in the realm of Computer Engineering. While i'm not studying , I'm love to dosports, particularly gymnastics something that i've been doing for almost my entire life.
