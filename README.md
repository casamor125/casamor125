Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Biel, a 21-year-old currently immersed in a professional development journey, pursuing a degree in Multiplatform Application Development. My programming experiences have revolved around Java and HTML/CSS, but i've done to a little of  Python, Kotlin, and Oracle SQL, with hands-on projects of software development. Outside the digital landscape, I've delved into the world of animation, creating some simple yet creatives animations at home.

Apart from my current studies, I invested two years in the realm of Computer Engineering. While i'm not studying , I'm love to dosports, particularly gymnastics something that i've been doing for almost my entire life. I'm not currently employed, but I'm open to exciting collaborations and opportunities in the tech world.
